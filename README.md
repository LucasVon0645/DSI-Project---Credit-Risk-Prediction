# DSI-Project---Credit-Risk-Prediction

This repository contains the project for the Data Science I lecture at TU Darmstadt. The goal of the project is to build a classifier to predict credit risk based on the public dataset "Statlog (German Credit Data)".

## Project Overview

Credit risk assessment is a critical task in the finance industry, aiming to evaluate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. Accurate prediction models can help financial institutions make informed lending decisions, reduce losses, and manage risk more effectively.
